# The Activation of a Thought Garden 

For years, I thought about starting a journal. I wanted a place to keep everything: my thoughts, ldeas, projects, sharing my knowledge and whatever I currently find interesting, all in one spot. Part of this was for me, so to be able to go back and read through my thoughts, my fears and aspirations and my recollection of each year because life gets busy and it's easy to forget. But I also wanted my children to have something to read one day, so they could see what their father was thinking during this time.

I thought about using a paper journal, but it just wasn’t practical. Paper can get lost, it’s hard to search through, and over time, it might disappear. So I decided to use a static website instead. It’s online, it lasts, and with today’s technology, it’s easy to search. Writing is simpler, and I can find any entry even years later.

Even after figuring out how to do it, I kept putting off when to start.

For a long time, I thought I needed perfect conditions to start: a quiet house, lots of energy in the morning, and a few hours with no interruptions. But as a senior engineer and a parent of two, that just isn’t possible. I kept making things too complicated and waiting for a stress-free time that was never going to happen.

**This page marks the end of that waiting.**
