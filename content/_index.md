# Longevity, Productivity, and AI

This site is where I experiment and share ideas. Here, I combine my technical background with my passion for helping people grow. I focus on three main areas:

1. **AI Security:** I work on keeping the 'AI Layer' in today’s technology safe and finding ways to turn technical risks into real business value.
2. **Productivity OS:** I create tools to help busy professionals, especially parents, get important things done without burning out.
3. **Longevity by Design:** I treat my health like it’s essential infrastructure. My goal is to have the energy and focus to be present for my two young kids.

I want to inspire a global shift in how people perform. My aim is to help high-achievers reconnect with themselves and move from living on autopilot to living with intention.

**This is where you can start making changes.**
