# Longevity, Productivity, and AI

This site is where I experiment and share new ideas. Here, I bring together my technical background and my interest in personal growth in today's AI world. I focus on three main areas:

1. **AI Security:**  I help secure the AI layer in modern technology and translate technical risks into business value..
2. **Productivity OS:** I create tools to help busy professionals, especially parents, get important things done without burning out.
3. **Longevity by Design:** I treat my health like it’s essential infrastructure. I want to have the energy and focus to be there for my two young kids and everything I do.

I want to inspire a global shift in how people perform. My aim is to help high-achievers reconnect with themselves and move from living on autopilot to living with intention.

**This is where we can start making changes.**
