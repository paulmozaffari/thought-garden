# When a film won’t leave you alone.

I recently watched *Big Bold Beautiful Journey*, and it did more than entertain me. It stirred up a tension I didn’t realize I was carrying and reflected a part of me that’s been quietly waiting for permission.

For years, I’ve built strong systems to keep things stable. As a NetSec professional and a parent, I’ve learned how to manage risk, create frameworks, and handle complexity under pressure. But the film made me ask a question that efficiency alone can’t answer:

> **“If I solved nothing else, would my days feel meaningful enough?”**

## The Three Doors

This realisation isn’t about being unhappy. It’s more about feeling a push to grow. I’ve gotten good at being efficient, but now I feel a need for something more meaningful. When I look at my journey, I see three doors this experience has opened:

### 1. From Optimisation to Meaning

Efficiency helps us get by, but living with purpose is what really matters. Sometimes we plan so much that our discipline becomes too heavy to carry. Planning feels safe, but taking action and finding meaning can feel risky. I want to do work that shows who I am, not just what I can do for a system.

### 2. The Life Un-Taken

Art often makes us think about the lives we could have lived, not with regret, but with curiosity. It asks: *What if I trusted my intuition more than my credentials? What if I let uncertainty in without trying to control it?* I’m starting to see that I don’t want to escape. I just want **permission** to be more than my résumé.

### 3. From Responsibility to Self-Authorship

This is the biggest door for me. I’ve spent much of my life focused on duty and being reliable, always making sure things turn out well. But at some point, you have to stop just protecting and start creating your own story.

## Survival is Solved. Now What?

The systems I’ve built are strong enough to support something more honest. I’m not asking, *“Can I do this?”* anymore. Now I’m asking, *“Does this show who I’m becoming?”*

I’m at the start of a chapter I chose for myself, not one I had to take.

## A Question to Sit With

If you’re in a similar place, where you’ve figured out how to get by but your spirit feels quiet, I invite you to think about this:

> **If the next 10 years were judged only by how alive you felt, what would quietly need to change first?**

Don’t make a plan. Don’t try to optimise. Just pay attention to what comes up.

That’s the door. Step through it.
