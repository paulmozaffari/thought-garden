For a long time, I wanted to start a journal. I needed a place to keep my thoughts, ideas, projects, and whatever I found interesting, all together. Part of the reason was so I could look back on my fears, hopes, and memories, since life moves fast and it’s easy to forget. I also wanted to leave something for my children, so one day they could see what their father was thinking during this important time.

I thought about using a paper journal, but it didn’t seem practical. Papers can get lost, are hard to organize, and might not last. So I chose this website instead. It’s reliable, easy to access, and searchable, which makes it simple to turn a thought into something lasting.

### The End of Waiting

Even after I figured out how to start, I kept putting off when to begin. I told myself I needed the perfect setup: a quiet house, lots of energy, and no interruptions. But as a senior engineer and a parent of two, that never happens. I kept trying to plan everything perfectly, but it just made me wait for a stress-free time that wasn’t coming.

**This page is where the waiting finally stops.**

I’ve worked in IT for almost thirty years. For 20 of those, I focused on enterprise networking and security, building systems for both government and private clients that worked in the real world, not just on paper.

But when I turned 50, I realised I didn’t want to be defined by a job title anymore. Now, I’m letting go of that old identity to become more of a leader, creator, and guide. This site is where I make that shift, moving from just doing the work to leading the conversation.
