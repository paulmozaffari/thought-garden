Security isn't the brakes. It's the steering wheel.

Most leaders still view AI Security as a "necessary tax" or the "Department of No." They believe security slows down innovation.

This is a fundamental misunderstanding of speed.

You don't put massive brakes on a Formula 1 car so it can drive slowly. You put them on so the driver can attack corners at 200mph without crashing.

Companies stalling on GenAI adoption right now aren't waiting for "better models." They are paralyzed by **undefined risk**. They are moving at 0 mph because they can't see the edges of the road.

*   **Undefined Risk** = Paralysis (The "Wait and See" trap)
*   **Defined Risk** = Velocity (The "Assess and Deploy" advantage)

AI Security doesn't just block threats. It defines the track boundaries so the business can finally put its foot down.

If you want to move faster than your competitors in 2026:
Stop treating security as a blocker. Start treating it as your deployment accelerator.
