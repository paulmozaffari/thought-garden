Today, the world spoke about romance, but my heart belonged entirely to **Iran**. Standing in the middle of Melbourne, surrounded by a sea of **Lion and Sun flags**, I felt a pride so deep it moved me to tears. I’ve lived through many February 14ths, but this one stands out. It was the day our shared grief for January’s martyrs turned into a powerful sense of hope.

### The Sight of Unity

When the news broke that over **one million Iranians** had gathered across Los Angeles, Munich, Toronto, and here in Australia, I felt our struggle become a bit lighter. For the first time, it didn’t feel like we were scattered around the world. it felt like we were united, one heart, and **one voice**.

The scale of these protests has forced a shift in international rhetoric. During the Munich Security Conference, Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi framed the current situation as the “final battle,” stating that the regime is at its weakest and “on the verge of collapse.

I couldn’t hold back my tears. Seeing us standing together against the occupation of our land, made me realise that the 40,000 brothers and sisters we lost last month did not fall for nothing. Their sacrifice has created a strong unity among us.

In Melbourne, the air was filled with a mix of sadness for those we lost and the energy of a revolution. We weren’t just protesting; we were taking back our identity.

### My Vow to the Fallen

To the 40,000 souls taken in the January massacres: **We heard you.** Even when the internet was cut and the world was silent, we still felt your presence. Today was our answer to the darkness. We showed the world that Iran is not the regime that occupies it; Iran is the millions of us who refuse to be silenced.

### A Note to My Future Self

Remember this feeling. Remember the tears on your cheeks and the sound of the chants echoing through the streets of Melbourne. This wasn’t just a “day of action”; it was a declaration of love. My Valentine was the hope for a secular, free, and prosperous Iran. We are the Lion and the Sun, and our new day is coming.
