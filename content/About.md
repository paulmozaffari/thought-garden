# Behind the Scenes

**I’m Paul.**

For years, I thought about starting a journal. I wanted a place to keep everything together: my thoughts, ideas, projects, and whatever knowledge I find interesting. Part of this is for me, so I can look back on my fears, hopes, and memories, since life gets busy and it’s easy to forget. I also want my children to have something to read one day, so they can see what I was thinking during this important time.

I thought about using a physical journal, but it didn’t seem practical. Papers can get lost, be hard to organise, and might disappear over time. So I chose this static website instead. It’s durable, online, and easy to search, especially now with AI. This way, my thoughts can quickly become something lasting.

### The End of Waiting

Even after I figured out how to do this, I kept putting off when to start. I told myself I needed perfect conditions: a quiet house, lots of energy, and no interruptions. But as a senior engineer and a parent of two, I know those moments never really happen. I kept trying to plan everything perfectly, waiting for a stress-free time that just doesn’t exist.

**This page marks the end of that waiting.**

### From 28 Years in the Digital Trenches

I have spent nearly three decades in IT. For 20 of those years, I specialised in enterprise networking and security, designing and implementing systems for government and private sectors that had to survive reality, not theory. 

But at 50, I realised I had outgrown being defined by a corporate title. Now, I’m letting go of that old identity to become more of a leader, creator, and guide. This space is where I make that shift, moving from being someone who just does the work to someone who leads the conversation.
