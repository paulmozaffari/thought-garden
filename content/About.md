### I build systems that hold up under pressure.

For the last 20 years, I've worked in the engine room of enterprise technology—designing, securing, and fixing the networks that power government and global telecom infrastructure.

I learned one truth the hard way: **Complexity is the enemy of execution.**

Today, I operate at the intersection of **AI Security** and **Human Performance**.

### The Shift to Authority

We are living through the biggest infrastructure shift since the internet: the rise of Generative AI. 

Most security leaders are still using 20-year-old tools (WAFs, DLPs) to fight 2026 problems (Prompt Injection, VibeScamming). My work focuses on the **Semantic Blind Spot**—helping leaders secure the *intent* of their AI systems, not just the network packets.

### The Philosophy: Time Aligned

I am also a husband and a father of two. I don't have the luxury of "hustle culture." I cannot out-work the chaos; I have to out-think it.

This constraint birthed my operating philosophy: **Time Aligned Execution.**

-   **I don't manage stress;** I build strength.
-   **I don't chase freedom;** I create it through daily, aligned progress.
-   **I believe in "Double-Lock" discipline:** Doing the work even when the motivation fades.

### What is this Garden?

This site is my laboratory. It is where I think in public about:
1.  **AI-Layer Security:** The frameworks we need for the next decade.
2.  **Productivity as Leverage:** Systems for busy professionals to ship meaningful work without burning out.
3.  **Mental Models:** Using Latticework Thinking to solve complex problems faster.

I don't teach theory. I share what I build, what I break, and what actually works when the pressure is on.
