<p>For years, I thought about starting a journal. I wanted a place to keep everything: my thoughts, beliefs, feelings, dreams, and even regrets, all in one spot. Part of this was for me, so I could look back and understand my choices. But I also wanted my children to have something to read one day, so they could see what their father was thinking during this important time.</p>
<p>I thought about using a paper journal, but it just wasn’t practical. Paper can get lost, it’s hard to search through, and over time, it might disappear. So I decided to use a static website instead. It’s online, it lasts, and with today’s technology, it’s easy to search. Writing is simpler, and I can find any entry even years later.</p>
<p>Even after figuring out how to do it, I kept putting off when to start.</p>
<p>For a long time, I thought I needed perfect conditions to start: a quiet house, lots of energy in the morning, and a few hours with no interruptions. But as a senior engineer and a parent of two, that just isn’t possible. I kept making things too complicated and waiting for a stress-free time that was never going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>This page marks the end of that waiting.</strong></p>
